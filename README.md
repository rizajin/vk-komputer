This repo will have a small study of a compute program and/or library.  

Basic things that I would like it to have are:  
Can be loaded with user parameters  
Can be loaded with user 'kernels'  
These two above are(would be) something of a more higher level(possibly a small language set or similar)  

Idea is to perform 'heavy' calculations on the GPU(GPGPU programming).  

Inspired by the CUDA which is a parallel computing platform from Nvidia
